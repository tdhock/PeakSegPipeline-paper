\title{A scalable machine learning pipeline for joint peak calling
  reveals differences between cell and experiment types}

  \caption{Comparison of peak detection error rate in two histone
    modification ChIP-seq experiments (panels from top to bottom) and
    two sample groups (panels from left to right). MACS, JAMM, and
    DFilter were run with parameters indicated by the authors for
    either sharp H3K4me3 or broad H3K36me3 data; parameters of
    PeakSegPipeline were learned using the train samples, and error
    rates were computed using the test samples. It is clear that the
    error rate of PeakSegPipeline is competitive with the other tools,
    and sometimes significantly lower.}

  \caption{Peak size varies with epigenome experiment
    type. PeakSegPipeline was trained on each data set, and used to
    predict peaks for each data set. It is clear that there are
    several distinct categories of peak sizes: large 30-50 kb
    (H3K36me3), medium 1--5 kb (H3K9me3, H3K27me3, H3K4me1, H3K27ac,
    H3K4me3), and small 200--400 b (ATAC, CTCF).}

  \caption{PeakSegPipeline detects peaks which are more well-defined
    relative to background than other tools (relative position of peak
    border shown in grey lines). The top 100 most likely/significant
    peaks are shown for each tool (panels from left to right) for one
    monocyte sample.  \textbf{Top}: broad H3K36me3 data, for which the
    most likely peaks are $\approx 100$ kb for PeakSegPipeline, but
    much smaller for the other tools. \textbf{Bottom}: sharp H3K4me3
    data, for which PeakSegPipeline and DFilter recover peaks with
    relatively large signal, but JAMM and MACS2 detect many noisy
    regions.}

\section{Time and memory requirements}

PeakSegPipeline uses algorithms with log-linear time complexity in the
number of samples and base pairs. The PeakSegFPOP algorithm for peak
prediction in a single sample with $n$ coverage data (lines in the
bedGraph file) uses $O(\log n)$ memory, $O(n \log n)$ disk space, and 
$O(n\log n)$ time
\citep{Hocking-constrained-changepoint-detection}. In practice we
assign each job 10GB RAM and 24 hours of compute time. The total
pipeline takes several hours or days to run (depending on the number
of labels and samples).

PeakSegPipeline analyzes the data at single base pair resolution, and
has no arbitrary bin or window size parameters.

JAMM ran out of memory (over 20GB) when analyzing the tcell group, which
had the most samples (15 H3K36me3 tcell samples, 19 H3K4me3 tcell
samples). So for the tcell group we only used five samples, which took
16GB of RAM and 11-16 hours of compute time.
